# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Synopsis

Representative Elementary Watershed type model for streamflow and stream temperature prediction in the Eel River watershed. 

## Motivation

In the seasonally dry Eel River watershed, how do climate, lithology, and land cover interact to determine water availability and stream temperature, especially during the dry season summer months? 

What controls the extent of wetted channel? 

How does hillslope aspect impact hillslope hydrologic fluxes and catchment scale channel conditions? 

How might future shifts in rainfall climatology impact flow regime? 

## Installation

Git to computer, install file to generate model directory.

## Requirements for running the model

To succesfully run the model, a number of files must be present in a folder titled `model_data`, which should be located in the parent directory of `StreamflowTempModel`. Many of the notebooks in `StreamflowTempModel/notebooks` demonstrate how these required files can be generated, however, the files can be prepared independently. Each file is stored as a pickled object.
