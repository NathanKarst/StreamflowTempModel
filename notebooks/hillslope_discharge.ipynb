    "# Computing Hillslope Discharge Across Multiple REWs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines how to access parameters and forcing data across a collection of REWs in order to compute hillslope discharge. We pay special attention to dealing with REW parameter groups, which simplify calibration procedures. In this example, we lay out the general organization to deal with multiple groups but will in fact only consider one. "

For each group, we can specific both scalars like field capacity or maximum evapotranspiration, and classes like specific groundwater and vadose zone mdoels. **The parameters enumerated for each group must include those needed to fully populate the chosen vadose zone and groundwater zone models, and the naming conventions between `group_params` and each class must match.** For instance, if the chosen vadose zone model has a field capacity attribute named `sfc`, then each value in the `group_params` dictionary must have a `sfc` key. Each REW will be instantiated using the parameters corresponding to the its `group` field in `rew_config`. This allows us to perform expensive calibration procedures only a few representative REW \"types\" (e.g., coastal belt covered in a Douglas fir), rather than on each REW individually. \n",
